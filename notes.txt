determine whether to encode new items when entering into item database?  
	is this necessary? 


generate new browserwindow for each interaction triggered by async action?


prelimiary bridgework between client window and main process in place.  
event listener firing to main on document click, bound to 'emit' property of
generated menu items from object structure.  

consider moving menu structure objects into their own files.  

NEED TO CLEAN UP index.js, and look @ passing data back to client from modal window. 

this modal concept still needs to be tested, should probably create a modal event listener
class to keep main window listener from becomin cluttererd with a million un-related 
modal communications.  

next step is to gather data form modal window, pass back to main for processing, and return results to 
DOM.  


modal listener acctive, working.  need to look @ deep copy of MenuStruct object for passing web params, or just provide default window params for all modals;
